                Jay is a devoted husband and loving father of four children and our loyal dog Teddy. This past year has been incredibly tough for our family. Jay was diagnosed with stage 5 kidney disease, meaning kidney failure, and since September, he’s been on dialysis. Jay and Lauren have been trained to administer Jay’s hemodialysis at home 5 days each week. It’s been a difficult and emotional journey for all of us, as dialysis isn’t a long-term solution, and it’s taking a toll on his health and well-being. Now, he urgently needs a kidney transplant, and we’re looking for a living donor to help give him a chance at a better life. Through all of this, our faith in God has been our rock, and we trust that He has a plan for our family, even in the midst of this struggle. We're holding on to hope that we’ll find someone who can help and make a huge difference for Jay’s future.
