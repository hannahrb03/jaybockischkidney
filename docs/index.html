                Jay is a devoted husband and loving father of four children and our loyal, furry baby, Teddy. Jay and Lauren have been trained to administer Jay’s hemodialysis at home 5 days each week since early September. In God’s gracious mercy and providence, one of the required heart tests for a kidney transplant revealed nearly 100 % heart blockage. This led to triple bypass open heart surgery on Christmas Eve Day. Thanks to the Lord, Jay was spared a massive heart attack and is recovering nicely and continuing with cardiac rehabilitation while back to work as a traffic engineer. Jay has been asked what he would like for his birthday (April 7th), and the answer is always the same: a kidney! Jay’s deepest desire is for a LIVING kidney.

                This past year has been incredibly tough for my family. My dad was diagnosed with stage 5 kidney disease, meaning his kidneys have failed, and since September, he’s been on dialysis. It’s been a difficult and emotional journey for all of us, as dialysis isn’t a long-term solution, and it’s taking a toll on his health and well-being. Now, he urgently needs a kidney transplant, and we’re looking for a living donor to help give him a chance at a better life. Through all of this, our faith in God has been our rock, and we trust that He has a plan for our family, even in the midst of this struggle. We're holding on to hope that we’ll find someone who can help and make a huge difference for my dad’s future.
