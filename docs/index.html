                Jay is a devoted husband and loving father of four children and our loyal, furry baby, Teddy. Jay and Lauren have been trained to administer Jay’s hemodialysis at home 5 days each week since early September. In God’s gracious mercy and providence, one of the required heart tests for a kidney transplant revealed nearly 100 % heart blockage. This led to triple bypass open heart surgery on Christmas Eve Day. Thanks to the Lord, Jay was spared a massive heart attack and is recovering nicely and continuing with cardiac rehabilitation while back to work as a traffic engineer. Jay has been asked what he would like for his birthday (April 7th), and the answer is always the same: a kidney! Jay’s deepest desire is for a LIVING kidney.

                Would you please join us in praying for God to provide Jay with a miraculous, living kidney? Would you also consider praying for Jay and passing this along to your friends? Thank you!
